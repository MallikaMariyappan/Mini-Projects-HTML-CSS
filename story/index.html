            Once, a town mouse visited its cousin, the
            country mouse. The country mouse was happy to see
            him. The town mouse was not happy with the simple
            lifestyle of his cousin. "Come home with me," he said.
            The country mouse was excited. He had never been to a
            town. The country mouse was amazed to see the tall
            buildings, The town mouse took him to a house. The
            table had been laid with wonderful dishes.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Just as they had started eating, a woman came
            with a broom. Scared, the country mouse ran all the
            way back home. He was better offin the country than in
            the town.
